(** Allow a local xen domain to read/write memory exported ("granted")
    from foreign domains. Safe memory sharing is a building block of all
    xen inter-domain communication protocols such as those for virtual
    network and disk devices.

    Foreign domains will explicitly "grant" us access to certain memory
    regions such as disk buffers. These regions are uniquely identified
    by the pair of (foreign domain id, integer reference) which is
    passed to us over some existing channel (typically via xenstore keys
    or via structures in previously-shared memory region).

      via a shared memory ring structure. *)
